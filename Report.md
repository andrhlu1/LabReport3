Part 1:

int[] reversed(int[] arr)

Bug: As it iterates through the array, it starts overwriting the first half of the array with the second half, but when it gets to the second half, it's actually overwriting with elements that it already changed.

Failure-inducing input:
```
 @Test
    public void testReversedFailure() {
        int[] input = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] expected = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        assertArrayEquals(expected, ArrayExamples.reversed(input));
    }
```
Input that doesn't induce a failure:
```
 @Test
    public void testReversedNoFailure() {
        int[] input = {};
        int[] expected = {};
        assertArrayEquals(expected, ArrayExamples.reversed(input));
    }
```
  Symptom:

  testReversedFailure test case would fail with an AssertionError because the expected output array is not equal to the actual output.
  ```
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: 
Expected :[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Actual   :[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

  Before-and-after:
```
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
  static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
}
```
The fix addresses the issue by correctly assigning the elements from the original array arr into the newArray in reversed order.

Part 2:

grep:

-r or --recursive: This option allows grep to perform a recursive search, looking into every file under each directory, and all subsequent subdirectories.

Example 1:
```
grep -r "function" ./technical/
```
This command searches for the word "function" in all files within the ./technical directory and all of its subdirectories.

Example 2:
```
grep --recursive "define" ./technical/includes/
```
This command recursively searches for the string "define" within files located in ./technical/includes and its subdirectories.

Usefulness: Recursively searching with grep is extremely useful for finding occurrences of a string or pattern within a complex directory structure.

Source: The recursive option is well-known, but can also be found in the grep man pages or on many Linux related websites such as GNU Grep Manual.

-i or --ignore-case: This option makes the search case-insensitive, allowing grep to match the pattern regardless of case.

Example 1:
```
grep -i "error" ./technical/logs/logfile.txt
```
This searches for the word "error" in a case-insensitive manner within logfile.txt.

Example 2:
```
grep --ignore-case "warning" ./technical/reports/
```
This command performs a case-insensitive search for "warning" within all files in the ./technical/reports/ directory.

Usefulness: The -i option is useful when the casing of the text is unknown or varied.

Source: Information about the -i option can be found in the manual pages (man grep) or on the GNU Grep Manual page.

-v or --invert-match: This inverts the search, causing grep to return lines that do not match the given pattern.

Example 1:
```
grep -v "success" ./technical/logs/logfile.txt
```
This command will print all lines from logfile.txt that do not contain the word "success".

Example 2:
```
grep --invert-match "passed" ./technical/results/*.txt
```
This command searches for files in ./technical/results/ that do not contain the word "passed".

Usefulness: Inverting match results is useful when you want to filter out lines that contain a certain pattern.

Source: The -v option is detailed in the grep manual (man grep) and in various online resources such as GNU Grep Manual.

-l or --files-with-matches: Instead of displaying every matching line, grep will only display the names of files with lines that match the pattern.

Example 1:
```
grep -l "deprecated" ./technical/src/*.c
```
This command lists the names of .c files under ./technical/src/ that contain the word "deprecated".

Example 2:
```
grep --files-with-matches "TODO" ./technical/
```
This command lists files in the ./technical/ directory that contain the term "TODO".

Usefulness: This option is great for quickly identifying files that contain the pattern, without displaying the actual matching lines.

Source: The -l option is commonly used by developers and can be found in the grep manual (man grep) and on online documentation like GNU Grep Manual.
